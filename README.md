**Abstract:**

In March 2020, the World Health Organization introduced a new infectious pandemic called “novel coronavirus disease” or “COVID-19”, which its origin dates back to World War II (1939) and spread from the city of Wuhan in China (2019). The severity of the outbreak has affected the health of many people around the world. This has led to the emergence of unimodal artificial intelligence approaches in self-assessment, screening, and diagnosis of coronavirus disease, but solely led to a significant percentage of false-negative results. In this study, 2500 COVID-19 samples including 10 features of clinical symptoms and physiological signs were combined using the early fusion type-I architecture and after data preparation with the pipeline of encoding, annotation, preprocessing, balancing, selection of effective features, post-processing, and rebalancing were evaluated the performance of twelve prediction models of machine learning containing traditional, ensemble, and feed-forward neural network models in terms of metrics and 10-fold cross-validation in the classification of three categories (non-suspicious, suspicious, and probable). For all features mode, both the **Extra Trees Classifier (ETC)** and **Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGB)** with the same score (99.6%), and for effective features mode, the **Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGB)** (97.3%) presented acceptable performance. Due to the lower priority of machine performance's time-taken in predicting the medical diagnostic problems, the stance of **selecting all the features** with the top-mentioned models is the most desirable for designing the COVID-19 self-assessment manual system.
